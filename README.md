# Raylib - Visual Studio Code Setup for GCC
This project sets everything up needed for raylib *(https://www.raylib.com/)* so you can code with Visual Studio Code *(https://code.visualstudio.com/)* instead of Notepad++.

# Note
The configuration assumes that you have installed Raylib3 in the default path: *C:/raylib*.

Make sure you have the *C/C++ Extension* for Visual Studio Code installed *(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)*.
You can install the extension via the *Extension Tab* in Visual Studio Code.

Configuration is for Windows.

When you want to hide the console, add the following compiler/linker configuration parameter:

*-mwindows*

# Installation
Just download or clone this repository and open the downloaded folder with Visual Studio Code *(right click-> Open with Code)*.

In Visual Studio Code you can run *example.c* by clicking the *Run-Button* in the *Run Tab*.
